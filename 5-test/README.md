#### Steps
- In the greetings directory, create a file called greetings_test.go.
Ending a file's name with _test.go tells the go test command that this file contains test functions.
- Also, test functions take a pointer to the testing package's testing.T type as a parameter. You use this parameter's methods for reporting and logging from your test.
- run test in verbose mode
` go test -v`
